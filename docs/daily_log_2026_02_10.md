## 1. Pre-Market Review (21:00 PM - Start of "Next Day" Logic)
- **Context**: The user requested a status update on the position opened yesterday (Feb 9).
- **Position Status**: **OPEN**.
    - **Expiry**: Feb 13, 2026 (Friday).
    - **PnL (Unrealized)**: +$7.08 USD.
    - **Legs**:
        - Long 682P / Short 684P
        - Short 704C / Long 706C
    - **Note**: The position was carried overnight because it is a weekly expiry (opened Monday, expires Friday), not 0DTE.

## 2. Session Activity
- **21:05 PM**: Monitor Resumed.
- **21:06 PM**: **Context Clarification**.
    - User Questions: "Did we open a Weekly by mistake?"
    - **Analysis**: Confirmed. `get_next_friday_expiry` logic forced Friday 13th expiry on a Monday 9th entry.
    - **Decision**: Keep position open as it is profitable (+$7.00) and within risk limits.
    - **Action Item**: Implement "True 0DTE" logic (Fix 5) for future sessions.
